			Build and Install Information

		Build

To perform a basic, release build of AftGangAglay - run `make' or `nmake'
within the project root directory. `nmake' must be run under a developer
command prompt.

If a debug build is desired - `DEBUG=1' must be appended to the invocation.

If cross-compiling, the variable `CROSS_TOOL' should be specified as a runner
for targeted system commands (e.g. `CROSS_TOOL=wine' for Windows-targeting
cross-compilation). If cross-compiling for macOS - `APPLE=1' must be appended
to the invocation. If cross-compiling for Windows - `WINDOWS=1' must be
appended to the invocation.

The `stdout' output of the build is a full reproduction of the build command
list. i.e. `make > test.sh' will produce a script equivalent to running `make'
without timestamping.

        Prerequisites

A functioning C compiler and archiver is all the project requires at a top
level. GNU/Make and Microsoft NMake are the only tested Make implementations.

Your system will need the `GL/' headers available on a system-level if
such is not already the case. On X based systems you will also need the
relevant XLib development package.
