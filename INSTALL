			Build and Install Information

		Build

To perform a basic, release build of AftGangAglay - run `make' within the
project root directory.

If building for macOS - `APPLE=1' must be appended to the invocation.
If building for Windows - `WINDOWS=1' must be appended to the invocation.
If a debug build is desired - `DEBUG=1' must be appended to the invocation.

If cross-compiling, the variable `CROSS_TOOL' should be specified as a runner
for targeted system commands (e.g. `CROSS_TOOL=wine' for Windows-targeting
cross-compilation). This is an annoying feature of the older build systems
present within dependencies. Builds make use of GNU/Make implicit rules,
and should respect all toolchain variables therein - with the addition of
`RANLIB'.

Builds have only presently been tested on a Linux machine - though should in
principle work on any UNIX-esque shell environment.

Tested/supported compilers are `gcc' and `clang' - of unknown minimum version.

		Install

Once you have a working build, you can install with `make install'.
The install prefix can be configured with the `PREFIX' variable (Default is
`/usr/local'). Root privileges may be required depending on the install
location. This installs the binary executable `aftgangaglay' for running
game projects, and `aga-vertgen' and `aga-sndgen' for generating model and
sound assets respectively.

        Other Prerequisites

Your system will need the `GL/' headers available on a system-level if
such is not already the case. Additionally, to build resources you will
need the `pip' packages `pyassimp' and `numpy', aswell as `ffmpeg'.
