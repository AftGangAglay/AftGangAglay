			Build and Install Information

To perform a basic, release build of AftGangAglay - run `make' within the
project root directory.

If building for macOS - `APPLE=1' must be appended to the invocation.
If building for Windows - `WINDOWS=1' must be appended to the invocation.
If a debug build is desired - `DEBUG=1' must be appended to the invocation.

If cross-compiling, the variable `CROSS_TOOL' should be specified as a runner
for targeted system commands (e.g. `CROSS_TOOL=wine' for Windows-targeting
cross-compilation). This is an annoying feature of the older build systems
present within dependencies. Builds make use of GNU/Make implicit rules,
and should respect all toolchain variables therein - with the addition of
`RANLIB'.

Builds have only presently been tested on a Linux machine - though should in
principle work on any UNIX-esque shell environment.

Tested/supported compilers are `gcc' and `clang' - of unknown minimum version.
