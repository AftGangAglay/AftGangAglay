            Support Scripts

Just a bit of a disclaimer - these scripts are not era-appropriate. But most of
the development tooling we're using isn't anyway.

`gensnd.sh' - converts any `ffmpeg' format to AGA 8khz u8 audio data
`aga.supp' - valgrind suppressions for graphics drivers and GLUT
`vertgen.py' - converts model formats to AGA packed models
