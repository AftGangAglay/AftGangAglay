			AftGangAglay
The best laid plans of mice and men

AftGangAglay (or AGA) is a game engine project aiming to build an
architecturally modern C codebase using technologies which existed at the time
of OpenGL 1.0s original specification (June 1992).

In particular - any program code which would be distributed with a game needs
to satisfy this requirement. Extra tooling such as a modern C compiler, helper
scripts etc. are allowed to be from the future. Additionally, some helper code
(which should be appropriately annotated) may break this rule to allow porting
to modern platforms - Windows didn't get OpenGL (WGL) until post-1996!

Ideally (where possible/appropriate), any task which can be undertaken by a
dependency of the era should do so. Examples here are using Python 0.9.1 from
1991 for scripting and using libwww to parse SGML for config.
