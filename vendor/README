Era-accurate LibWWW version pulled from here:
https://www.w3.org/History/1992/WWWLibrary_2.11.tar.Z
With a large part of the codebase stripped out such as build scripts and
irrelevant platform code.

Python 0.9.1 from 1991 pulled from here:
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/src/Python-0.9.1.tar.gz

SGI Demos pulled from here:
https://ftp.zx.net.nz/pub/archive/ftp.sgi.com/sgi/opengl/CAL/s97demos.sgi.tar.gz
For a closer to era-accurate OBJ parser and reference implementations of GL
techniques.

XLib is going to be stuck requiring whatever very late system version is
available for now, as the original GLX was proprietary until 1999.
